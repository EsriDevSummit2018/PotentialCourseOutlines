Since TypeScript is mostly concerned with strong typing and Object Orientation features, a 2 day class trying to cover both JavaScript and TypeScript topics would not be able to dive into very "Advanced" topics.  It could either bounce between JavaScript and corresponding TypeScript topics, like this course outline:

[TypeScript and JavaScript Development](https://github.com/EsriDevSummit2018/PotentialCourseOutlines/blob/master/Esri%20TypeScript%20and%20JavaScript%20Development.md)

Or it could cover the basics of TypeScript on Day 1, and then try and cover some Advanced topics on Day 2.  Such as this outline:

[Introduction to TypeScript and Advanced JavaScript](https://github.com/EsriDevSummit2018/PotentialCourseOutlines/blob/master/Esri%20Introduction%20to%20TypeScript%20and%20Advanced%20JavaScript.md)

In my opinion, the best option is to offer 2 separate sessions if possible.  

[Esri TypeScript Development](https://github.com/EsriDevSummit2018/PotentialCourseOutlines/blob/master/Esri%20TypeScript%20Development.md)  
[New and Advanced JavaScript Features](https://github.com/EsriDevSummit2018/PotentialCourseOutlines/blob/master/Esri%20New%20and%20Advanced%20JavaScript%20Features.md)
